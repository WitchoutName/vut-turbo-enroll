## How It Works

This extension uses a combination of background scripts, content scripts, and messaging to achieve its functionality.

- Manages alarms for scheduling registration.
- Communicates with the popup and content script using message passing.
- Creates and cancels alarms for registration.
- Handles the logic for registering the selected class block.
- The **Content Script** :
- Injected into the VUT website.
- Allows users to select a class block by clicking on it.
- Communicates with the background script to trigger registration.
- The **Popup** :
- Provides a user-friendly interface for setting the registration time.
- Communicates with the background script to schedule registration and cancel it if needed.

## Installing
